<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Combustion</li><li>Internal Combustion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas power generation utilizes organic waste to produce energy, with two primary market types: external combustion and internal combustion. In external combustion systems, biogas is burned outside the engine to generate heat, which then produces steam for turbines, driving electricity generation. Conversely, internal combustion systems directly use biogas in engines, converting its chemical energy into mechanical power. Both methods facilitate renewable energy production and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to sustainable energy solutions.</p></p>
