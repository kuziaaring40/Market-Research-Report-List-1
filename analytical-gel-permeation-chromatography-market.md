<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analytical Gel Permeation Chromatography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ambient Temperature</li><li>High Temperature</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analytical Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) encompasses two primary market types: ambient temperature and high temperature. Ambient temperature GPC operates under standard conditions, suitable for analyzing heat-sensitive polymers without degradation. This method focuses on precise molecular weight determination and polymer characterization. In contrast, high temperature GPC involves elevated temperatures to facilitate the analysis of polymers that may be soluble only at higher thermal conditions. This approach enhances sample solvation and reduces viscosity, enabling more accurate results for certain polyolefins and thermoplastic elastomers.</p></p>
