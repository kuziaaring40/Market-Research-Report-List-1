<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofocal IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aspheric Monofocal IOLs</li><li>Spheric Monofocal IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Monofocal Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is primarily divided into two types: Aspheric Monofocal IOLs and Spheric Monofocal IOLs. Aspheric Monofocal IOLs are designed to reduce spherical aberrations, enhancing image quality and contrast sensitivity, particularly in low-light conditions. In contrast, Spheric Monofocal IOLs maintain a uniform curvature, offering reliable visual correction but may not perform as well in varying light conditions. Both types aim to provide clear vision after cataract surgery, catering to different patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
